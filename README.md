# Omnical

This is omnical, a module for redundant-baseline calibration of interferometric visibilities [(Liu et al. 2010)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.5268). It was used for [Zheng et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5527) and [Ali et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06016) and [early HERA analysis](http://reionization.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IDR2.1_Memo_v2.html). 

Omnical has been superceded by [hera_cal's redcal module](https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_cal/blob/master/hera_cal/redcal.py), but is being kept here for legacy purposes. There are no plans to update or maintain this repo. 

[A memo explaining omnical's mathematical operation here](http://reionization.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/HERA_memo050_Omnical-Convergence.pdf), along with a comparison to redcal.
